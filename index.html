          <h2>We love cultivating</h2>
          <p>
            Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part
            of horticulture. Long time ago whealty ancient Egyptians used
            gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens
            with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens.
            <br />Hello, I am Maria. In 2004, my husband Jason and I founded the
            Lucky Scrub, a design firm that specializes in garden design and
            creation, maintenance and landscaping. Jason and I share a long-time
            love for plants of all kinds and we would love to transform your
            outdoor area into a heavenly place. <br />Visit us at our store in
            sunny Tuscon, Arizona to meet us in person! If you can't make it

          <h2>Discover the nursery</h2>
          <p>
            Since 2016, we are running a petit plant nursery that sells both
            indoor and outdoor plants, making us a one-stop shop for our clients
            to transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of. <br />
            personally oversee the production of seedlings and their growth
            until our shrubs and pink flowers are ready to leave the nest. I bet
            our pink flowers look gorgeous in your garden too!
